# 📷 Image Processing using MATLAB  

## 📝 What is Image Processing?  
**Image Processing** is a technique used to enhance, manipulate, and analyze images to extract meaningful information. It plays a crucial role in **computer vision, medical imaging, object detection, and automation**. Common tasks include **noise reduction, edge detection, segmentation, and feature extraction**.  

## 🛠 Why MATLAB for Image Processing?  
MATLAB provides a **powerful Image Processing Toolbox** with built-in functions for efficiently handling **image transformations, filtering, enhancement, and analysis**. It simplifies complex operations like:  
- Converting images to grayscale or binary  
- Applying filters for noise removal and edge detection  
- Performing segmentation and object recognition  
- Extracting features for further analysis  

## 📂 Lab Work & Assignments  
I have added some of my **lab work and assignments** as **ZIP files** in this repository. These contain **MATLAB scripts, sample images, and documentation** showcasing various **image processing techniques** used in my coursework.
